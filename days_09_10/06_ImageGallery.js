// When an Image is Clicked:

// 1. Update the caption: Retrieve a description from the image’s data and display it.
// 2. Show a larger version: Replace the current large image with a bigger version of the clicked image.
// 3. Track how many times the image has been clicked:
//          If it’s the first time, initialize a counter.
//          Otherwise, increase the count and display the updated number.
